# BLIGHT-TICKET-COMPLIANCE-PREDICTION
Blight, or properties that have not been adequately maintained, is a common and costly issue in Detroit. Blight violation notices, also known as blight tickets, were first issued by Detroit's city in 2005 to allow residents to maintain their homes in good repair or contribute to the city's renewal efforts. Landowners who have violated City of Detroit ordinances regulating how property owners must preserve the exterior of their property have been issued Blight Violation Notices (BVN) or Blight Tickets, and many of these fines go unpaid. The city government requires measures to increase blight ticket compliance. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is an expensive and time-consuming operation.   Through this project, the teams' primary goal is to explore what factors make a citizen comply with a blight ticket, thereby predicting whether a specific blight ticket would be paid on time.
